    <h5>This page will either launch into an external groupme, or slack channel for each class
      that the student is enrolled in. This reduces the cost of the application, as well as
      eliminates the need to handle massive amounts of message data.
      Working with these external chat applications is still in it's testing phase and was
      therefore not implemented in this prototype application.
